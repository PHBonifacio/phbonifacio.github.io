## Who am I

I'm an electrical engineer graduated from Londrina State University. Currently, I'm working as security specialist for ATM machines, developing secure software, also doing malware analysis and penetration tests. 

I had worked with POS systems, developing new products and implementating new features. I had experience with embedded Linux, Bluetooth, EMV Cards, ISO 14443.

Also, I had experiences developing embedded systems for fleet tracking. I had worked with 8/16/32-bit ARM and PIC microcontrollers, developing baremetal and RTOS firmware.
